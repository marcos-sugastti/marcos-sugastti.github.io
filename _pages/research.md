### Community Matters: Psychological Well-Being and Spillovers in an Asset-Building Anti-Poverty Program in Paraguay [[Paper](https://marcos-sugastti.github.io/Sugastti_JMP.pdf) | [Slides](https://marcos-sugastti.github.io/Graduation.pdf)]

<summary>Abstract</summary>
<br>
Asset-building anti-poverty programs that follow BRAC’s graduation approach generally yield positive average treatment effects on economic variables, though these figures obscure
sizable heterogeneity, and the psychological effects of the programs remain understudied. Leveraging a randomized controlled trial with a staggered rollout and saturation
design, I examine how and for whom the Paraguayan government’s graduation program works. Midline findings indicate that while the program improves key economic outcomes for most treated households, impacts vary widely across the distribution of participants. I also find that the program worsens the psychological state of beneficiaries mid-program, with measures of depression, locus of control, aspirations, and self-efficacy suggesting that the expectation for program participants to transform their livelihoods may induce stress. A saturation analysis shows that this psychological decline seems to be attenuated in communities with a greater share of beneficiary households, highlighting the role of community
dynamics in supporting participants. In fact, psychological factors may act as an important source of spillover effects, as beneficiaries in these communities experience better economic
outcomes than those in communities where fewer neighbors receive the program. The paper discusses what these findings imply for the cost-effective design and implementation of graduation programs.

### The Impact of Natural Disasters on Risk Preferences, Subjective Beliefs, and Related Behavior: Evidence from Typhoon Ketsana (with Sean F. Kiely) [[Slides](https://marcos-sugastti.github.io/The Impact of Natural Disasters.pdf)]

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<br>
We study how individuals' risk preferences, subjective beliefs about future shocks, and related behavior change following a natural disaster. We focus on the impact of Typhoon Ketsana in 2009—one of the most devastating storms to hit Southeast Asia in recent times. Our analysis reveals that individuals who were affected by the typhoon become more risk averse a year after landfall. This effect persists up to four years later. We base our findings on household-level panel data from Vietnam and a difference-in-differences strategy with a continuous treatment variable that exploits variation in the intensity of the typhoon. We conclude that a standard deviation (SD) increase in excess rainfall during the typhoon leads to a 0.23 SD increase in risk averseness one year after landfall, and a 0.24 SD increase four years after landfall. Moreover, individuals exposed to higher excess rainfall are more likely to believe that storms will not transpire in the following five years or will occur with reduced frequency. This result supports the view that the main observed effects on risk preferences indeed reflect updated risk attitudes, rather than changes in the subjective probability structure assigned to the occurrence of storms. Finally, we show that individuals exposed to the typhoon increase their insurance purchasing in the long term. Our paper contributes to the literature that empirically documents how negative shocks may alter risk preferences and helps illuminate the way climate-related hazards can induce changes in the attitudes and economic behavior of individuals.

### The Economics of Sovereign Insurance in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (with Michael R. Carter) [[Slides](https://marcos-sugastti.github.io/Economics of Sovereign Insurance.pdf)]

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<br>
The increased frequency and severity of natural disasters have led to the emergence of new tools for disaster risk finance, including sovereign index insurance contracts that provide governments with budgetary support for infrastructure replacement costs and excess social protection payments that accumulate in the wake of hurricanes and droughts. While multiple factors must be considered when determining whether such contracts are warranted, here we focus on core economic considerations: when does the protection offered by these sovereign contracts make sound public finance sense? To address this question, we propose two conceptual metrics. The first is based on minimizing the economic cost of meeting disaster-induced excess budgetary expenditures. The second focuses on maximizing social welfare within a fixed government budget. We then illustrate the use of these concepts using data from Kenya and analyzing the efficacy of an example parametric sovereign risk contract developed to meet the country’s excess social protection needs resulting from drought events in the rangeland areas. While we stress that the benchmark data available for evaluating the contract are imperfect, we find that the proposed contract outperforms a go-it-alone (no insurance) policy under both metrics, even when we assume commercial mark-up rates on the insurance. We also find that the proposed contract falls well short of what a perfect parametric contract could achieve, highlighting the importance of quality assessment methodologies to compare alternative options. Overall, we propose a methodology for comparing the performance of different sovereign-level parametric insurance contracts and establishing a minimum quality threshold.

### Asset Protection and Disaster Risk Financing to Improve Shock-responsive Social Protection in Latin America and the Caribbean (with Michael R. Carter) [[Slides](https://marcos-sugastti.github.io/Shock-responsive SP in LAC.pdf)]

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<br>
In Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), the poorest and most vulnerable households predominantly engage in informal work or self-employment and are often beyond the reach of conventional income maintenance programs that provide shock-responsive social protection for the formally employed. While the poorest households sometimes benefit from conditional cash transfers and economic inclusion asset-building programs, making these programs shock-responsive requires recognizing these households as active economic actors who need to build and protect the assets crucial to their livelihood and resilience. Although there has been some progress toward making cash transfer schemes shock-responsive, we argue that effective social protection for this population must extend beyond scalable cash payments and include customizable asset protection schemes tailored to individual asset exposure. The payoffs from such schemes could be substantial in terms of improved asset accumulation incentives, long-term poverty reduction, and resilience. These schemes could leverage parametric disaster risk financing instruments of the sort already present in the region to provide predictable, reliable, and customizable support to the target population. In addition to our core argument concerning the protection of the poorest in LAC, we also examine the role of parametric or index insurance products in underwriting scalable social protection obligations of governments. Our analysis suggests a cautionary perspective on the conventional logic regarding the important role that parametric insurance products can play as a form of stochastic government support. We show that the degree of reliance on these products depends critically on the reliability of the underlying parametric index. This point is particularly important given our emphasis on the need for reliable social protection programs that enhance and sustain asset building and protection for the poorest.
