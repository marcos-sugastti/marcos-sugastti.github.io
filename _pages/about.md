I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Agricultural & Resource Economics at UC Davis. My fields of interest are development and public economics. I am particularly interested in questions about social protection, climate resilience, and risk and insurance in developing countries. I am actively conducting fieldwork in my home country of Paraguay. 

You can find my CV here.
