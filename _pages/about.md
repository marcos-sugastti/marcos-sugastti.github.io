I am a development economist studying social protection, mental health, resilience to climate shocks, and risk and insurance. I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the [Jameel Observatory for Food Security Early Action, based in the University of Edinburgh](https://jameelobservatory.org/food-security-early-action/). 

I received a PhD in Agricultural and Resource Economics from [UC Davis](https://are.ucdavis.edu/) in 2025. During my PhD, I worked as a consultant for the World Bank and conducted fieldwork in my home country of Paraguay.

Before entering my doctoral program, I graduated from [Columbia University](https://econ.columbia.edu/) with a BA in Economics-Mathematics and a Concentration in Latin American and Caribbean Studies. I have worked in Asunci√≥n as a Policy Analyst at the [Secretariat of Planning for Economic and Social Development](https://www.stp.gov.py/) and as a Research Associate at [Instituto Desarrollo](https://desarrollo.edu.py/en/home/). I am also a long-time collaborator of [OMAPA](https://www.omapa.org/), the Paraguayan mathematical olympiads organization.
