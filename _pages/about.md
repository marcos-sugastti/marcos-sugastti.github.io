I am a PhD Candidate in Agricultural and Resource Economics at UC Davis. My fields of interest are development and public economics. I am particularly interested in questions about social protection,  psychological well-being, risk and insurance, and climate resilience in developing countries. I am actively conducting fieldwork in my home country of Paraguay. 

You can find my CV here.

Before entering my doctoral program, I graduated from Columbia University with a Bachelor's in Economics-Mathematics and a Concentration in Latin American and Caribbean Studies. I have worked as a Policy Analyst at the Secretariat of Planning for Economic and Social Development and as a Research Associate at Instituto Desarrollo. I have also lectured at the Catholic University of Asunci√≥n and I am a long-time collaborator of OMAPA, the Paraguayan mathematical olympiads organization.
