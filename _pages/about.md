I am a PhD Candidate in Agricultural and Resource Economics at UC Davis, with research interests in development and public economics. My current work focuses on social protection, psychological well-being, resilience to shocks such as climate change, and risk and insurance in developing countries. I am actively conducting fieldwork in my home country of Paraguay. 

You can find my CV [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/hplikq48vlx8b9o2w0jjx/Sugastti_CV_0824.pdf?rlkey=9secnov1pmxq0ej0dnntborm4&st=pv6e9act&dl=0).

Before entering my doctoral program, I graduated from Columbia University with a BA in Economics-Mathematics and a Concentration in Latin American and Caribbean Studies. I have worked in Asunci√≥n as a Policy Analyst at the Secretariat of Planning for Economic and Social Development and as a Research Associate at Instituto Desarrollo. I am also a long-time collaborator of OMAPA, the Paraguayan mathematical olympiads organization.
