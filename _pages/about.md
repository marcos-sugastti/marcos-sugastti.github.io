I am a PhD Candidate in Agricultural and Resource Economics at UC Davis. My fields of interest are development and public economics. I am particularly interested in questions about social protection,  psychological well-being, risk and insurance, and climate resilience in developing countries. I am actively conducting fieldwork in my home country of Paraguay. 

You can find my CV [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/bhgfntbd7ywmhevn2y67f/Sugastti_CV_0624.pdf?rlkey=myhbgqwyeacrdjchhorimlm4g&st=o0jtjxlw&dl=0).

Before entering my doctoral program, I graduated from Columbia University with a BA in Economics-Mathematics and a Concentration in Latin American and Caribbean Studies. I have worked as a Policy Analyst at the Paraguayan Secretariat of Planning for Economic and Social Development and as a Research Associate at Instituto Desarrollo. I am also a long-time collaborator of OMAPA, the Paraguayan mathematical olympiads organization.
