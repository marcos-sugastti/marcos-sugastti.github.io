I am a PhD Candidate in [Agricultural and Resource Economics at UC Davis](https://are.ucdavis.edu/), with research interests in development and public economics. In August 2025, I will join the [Jameel Observatory for Food Security Early Action at the University of Edinburgh](https://jameelobservatory.org/food-security-early-action/) as a postdoctoral researcher.

My work focuses on social protection, mental health, resilience to climate shocks, and risk and insurance in developing countries. I am currently affiliated with the [Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Markets, Risk, and Resilience (MRR)](https://basis.ucdavis.edu/) at UC Davis and have worked as a consultant for the World Bank. I have conducted fieldwork in my home country of Paraguay.

Before entering my doctoral program, I graduated from [Columbia University](https://econ.columbia.edu/) with a BA in Economics-Mathematics and a Concentration in Latin American and Caribbean Studies. I have worked in Asunci√≥n as a Policy Analyst at the [Secretariat of Planning for Economic and Social Development](https://www.stp.gov.py/) and as a Research Associate at [Instituto Desarrollo](https://desarrollo.edu.py/en/home/). I am also a long-time collaborator of [OMAPA](https://www.omapa.org/), the Paraguayan mathematical olympiads organization.
